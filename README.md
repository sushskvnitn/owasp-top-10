## OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

This project covers the following vulnerabilities:

1. **Injection**: Prevent SQL and command injection attacks by sanitizing inputs.
2. **Broken Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms and session management.
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: Securely configure XML parsers to prevent XXE attacks.
5. **Broken Access Control**: Enforce proper access controls for user roles and data.
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: Harden security settings and disable unnecessary services.
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Sanitize user inputs to prevent malicious script execution.
8. **Insecure Deserialization**: Avoid deserializing untrusted data to prevent code execution.
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Keep dependencies up to date and secure.
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Implement proper logging and monitoring to detect attacks.
